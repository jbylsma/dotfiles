*
* This layout uses the Windows thumb key mode, which is also the default
* Kinesis thumb key mode. Although the mapping remaps the Windows key to Alt,
* it retains the Windows key in keypad mode. It is necessary to reload the
* layout if the thumb key mode has been switched, as thumb key mode switching
* also unbind scrolls.
*
* When remapping keys via the program keys, the input order is destination, source.
